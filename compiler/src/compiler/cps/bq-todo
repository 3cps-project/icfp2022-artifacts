Important
 - Update analysis scope to include data structure and tuple extent analysis
 - Patch and improve display analysis
 - add word evaluation into interpreters


Not as important

 - Update call-web analyses to include type contexts
    - Then we can do some monomorphization transforms
 - We could write a module that approximates the "size" of
   closures if we want to use that for measurements
 - Mirror analyses for continuation stuff (and add dumping/allocation/etc to JSON)

 - Patch CPS optimizations, in particular the argument expander to eliminate tuples
    - I should be able to handle modifying the types correctly, but I might need help with this
    - ON HOLD: fails since I tranform based on call webs, not call wbes + types.
      I actually don't translate any types yet, and the analysis depends on types,
      so everything breaks after the optimization pass
